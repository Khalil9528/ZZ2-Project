This Car class has the following attributes:

*   color: The color of the car.
*   speed: The current speed of the car (in km/h).
*   isStarted: A boolean indicating whether the car is started or not.

The class also includes methods to:

*   Start and stop the car.
*   Increase and decrease the speed of the car.
*   Getters for color, speed, and start status.

Example usage:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("red", 60);

        // Start the car
        myCar.startCar();

        // Increase the speed
        myCar.accelerate(10);

        // Decrease the speed
        myCar.brake(5);

        // Stop the car
        myCar.stopCar();
    }
}

This will output:

Car started. Speed: 60 km/h
Speed increased to 70 km/h
Speed decreased to 65 km/h
Car stopped. Speed: 0 km/h
